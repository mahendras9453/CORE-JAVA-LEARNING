        /*Final conclusion
                Based of data  types we have two types of variable for storing a value and an object refernce.
             1)Primitive data type
             2)Referenced datatype
             Both are of two types
             1)class level var
            2) method level var
             class  level var are divided into two types
             static and non-static
              method  level var are divided into two types
              parameter and local
               all four types of var can be primitive and referenced.
