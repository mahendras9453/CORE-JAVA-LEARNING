       Types of the Data types in Java
       1: Primitive Data types  (8)  also known as (base types)
       2: Referenced Data types  (2+6)  also known as (Derived types)
     - Primitive Data types  are used for the creating a variable for soring
       single value .
       A variable is a single value memory.
     - Referenced data types are used for creating an object for storing the values .
       An object is a multiple value  memory .
