          what is oops?
          oops, is a  technique .It provides set of suggestion for creating real-world object in programming
           world by achieving security and dynamic binding.
           why oops?
           1) To create real - worlds object in programming world
           2) To achieve security to object data
           3) to achieve dynamic binding between objects communication.
