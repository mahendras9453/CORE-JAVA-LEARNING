    Binding fields and methods
    1. Binding means connecting
       The process of accessing fields (SV an NSV ) of a class
       from its methods is called binding fields and methods
       2. The need of accessing / binding fields with methods is in project we must perform 4
        operations
        a) Initializing object
        b) reading object data
        c) Modifying object data
        d) Printing object data
        repeatedly for every object created from a class
       3. To perform above four operations
           For developing logic one time and to reuse that
           logic repeatedly for very object , we must bind variables and methods .

     */

    //We write  so that the values passed into the method are stored in the object’s fields.
    // Without , if parameter names match field names, the assignment would fail to update the object.
