        A sequence of statement placed as one group with proper name and return type us called method.
        How to create a method?
        to create method you should know-
        -What is an operation?
        -What are the inputs needed to perform this operation?
        - What is the logic to perform this operation?
        - what is type of result returning form thus operation?
        - what is the exception throwing from this operation?
        - what are the permissions we must set to access and execute this operation?

     Method terminology
     1) prototype -- Head of the method is known as prototype that contains modifiers, return type,methodname,
                     , parameter and throws exception list is called prototype
     2) Body and logic--- just the place between {} is called body.
                          The statement placed in the method is called logic
     3) Signature----------  Method name and parameters list together we called signature
     4) Parameter and Argument--- The variable that is declared in method parenthesis () is called parameter
                                  The value we are passing as input to a method parameter is called argument
     5) Method name------    The name of a method that represents an operation performed by this is called method name
     6) Return type--------A data type placed in the method protype before method name is called return type.
     7) Modifiers----------  A key word or set of keywords those modifiers default .behaviour or operation of a programming element is called modifier
                           The AM specifies where we can access this Pe and ELM specifies we can access and how we can executes his PE
                           either wih object or directly by class name.
